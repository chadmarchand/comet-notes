# Comet Notes
Comet Notes is a personal wiki application. It is based on a serverless backend using an AWS Lambda
function built in Node.js. The lambda function provides a GraphQL endpoint which resolves to an Amazon RDS
PostgreSQL database.

See the [Comet Notes Lambda Readme](lambda/README.md) for instructions on packaging and deployment.
