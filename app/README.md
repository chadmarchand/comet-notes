# CometNotes App

The `comet-notes` app is written in JavaScript and uses [React](https://reactjs.org/). In addition to running in the browser, [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) is used in order to build a cross-platform desktop app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run electron-start`

Opens up a window pointing to the app using electron. You must run `npm start` first in order to start the app server.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
